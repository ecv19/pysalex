description: "Modules to conduct exploratory analysis of spatial and spatio-temporal data"
summary: "The `explore` layer includes modules to conduct exploratory analysis of spatial and spatio-temporal data. At a high level, packages in `explore` are focused on enabling the user to better understand patterns in the data and suggest new interesting questions rather than answer existing ones. They include methods to characterize the structure of spatial distributions (either on networks, in continuous space, or on polygonal lattices). In addition, this domain offers methods to examine the *dynamics* of these distributions, such as how their composition or spatial extent changes over time."
