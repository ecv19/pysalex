description: "Spaghetti supports the the spatial analysis of graphs, networks, topology, and inference. It includes functionality for the statistical testing of clusters on networks, a robust all-to-all Dijkstra shortest path algorithm with multiprocessing functionality, and high-performance geometric and spatial computations using geopandas that are necessary for high-resolution interpolation along networks, and the ability to connect near-network observations onto the network."
