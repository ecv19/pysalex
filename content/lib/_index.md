description: "Core spatial data structures, file IO. Construction and interactive editing of spatial weights matrices & graphs. Alpha shapes, spatial indices, and spatial-topological relationships" 
summary: "solve a wide variety of computational geometry problems including graph construction from polygonal lattices, lines, and points, construction and interactive editing of spatial weights matrices & graphs - computation of alpha shapes, spatial indices, and spatial-topological relationships, and reading and writing of sparse graph data, as well as pure python readers of spatial vector data. Unike other PySAL modules, these functions are exposed together as a single package."
