description: "Libpysal provides foundational algorithms and data structures that support the rest of the library. This currently includes the following modules: input/output (`io`), which provides readers and writers for common geospatial file formats; weights (`weights`), which provides the main class to store spatial weights matrices, as well as several utilities to manipulate and operate on them; computational geometry (`cg`), with several algorithms, such as Voronoi tessellations or alpha shapes that efficiently process geometric shapes; and an additional module with example data sets (`examples`)."
