description: "Spreg supports the estimation of classic and spatial econometric models. Currently it contains methods for estimating standard Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) and Seemingly Unrelated Regressions (SUR), in addition to various tests of homokestadicity, normality, spatial randomness, and different types of spatial autocorrelation. It also includes a suite of tests for spatial dependence in models with binary dependent variables."
