description: "Spvcm provides a general framework for estimating spatially-correlated variance components models. This class of models allows for spatial dependence in the variance components, so that nearby groups may affect one another. It also also provides a general-purpose framework for estimating models using Gibbs sampling in Python, accelerated by the `numba` package."
