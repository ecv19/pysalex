summary: "The `viz` layer provides functionality to support the creation of geovisualisations and visual representations of outputs from a variety of spatial analyses. Visualization plays a central role in modern spatial/geographic data science. Current packages provide classification methods for choropleth mapping and a common API for linking PySAL outputs to visualization tool-kits in the Python ecosystem."
