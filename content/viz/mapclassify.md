description: "Mapclassify provides functionality for Choropleth map classification. Currently, fifteen different classification schemes are available, including a highly-optimized implementation of Fisher-Jenks optimal classification. Each scheme inherits a common structure that ensures computations are scalable and supports applications in streaming contexts."
